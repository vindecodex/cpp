### My Code when learning C++

My very first exploration with c++

### Compilation

`g++ *.cpp -o executable_name` >> use this for compiling multiple source files and linking them.

`g++ *.cpp -o executable_name -c` >> add with -c if you don't want to link the source files.

##### Suggestion

It is better to use CMake instead for best practice.
